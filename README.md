## Motivation

After years of failed attempts to organize my 10,000+ track collection, I built what every music lover needs: a way to tag, rate, and find music the way your brain thinks about it.

### **Track Tagging**

Rate tracks, set energy levels, and apply custom tags. Turn vague music memories into organized, searchable data.

### **Creating & Managing Tags**

Build your own tag system that matches how _you_ think about music.

### **Smart Filtering & Playlist Creation**

Create playlists by filtering by any combination of tags, ratings, energy, and BPM.
